     if we talk about console.log(); |console is an object provided by js and log is a function that is saved inside console object|

     console.log(typeof console);

       JSON.stringify(product2) is a method where JSON is a object which contains a function called stringify and it is used to convert js object to JSON object.
     JSON doesn't support single quotes it used double quotes to string and this below method converts to string typeof and we can verify using typeof in front of JSON.stringfigy(js object name)
     console.log(typeof JSON.stringify(product2));
     const jsonString=JSON.stringify(product2);
     console.log(JSON.parse(jsonString));/*used to convert back to js from JSON

     to store value which will stay even when we refresh the page is done by using local storage as below:
     localStorage.setItem('message','hello'); -> to store key value pair in the localStorage and yes this is the required format.Note that localStorate only supports string
     
     now to get it back from storage we use:
     localStorage.getItem('message');

     localStorage.setItem('message','hello');


     console.log(localStorage.getItem('message'));

     /*if we want to store value of a key from a object and we know that the variable name we are using is same as that key name then we can use shortcut
